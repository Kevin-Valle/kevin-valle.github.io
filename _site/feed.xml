        <title>Week 2</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This week’s lecture involved becoming familiar with some of C++’s unique features such as pointers, references, containers, iterators, and templates. It has been a while since I have used pointers and references so I have to put in a little extra effort when working on the exercises in class. I am not familiar with C++’s containers and iterators so this week’s lecture felt a little over my head but some practice would help alleviate that feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professor Downing then introduced and explained the second project, which is similar to the logic of a makefile. At first glance, this project seems simple but the more you look at it, the harder it looks considering the time given to have it completed. That combined with no provided files this time around make this project harder than the last but make it more of a learning experience. Having never written a travis.yml or makefile, I am glad I get to practice with a similar project to reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tip of the week: One of my biggest pet peeves while working on a project is switching contexts whenever working with issues on Github. Since I am doing most of my development and testing on the command line, I decided to look for a tool that would allow me to create, edit, and close issues on the fly also via the command line. That brings me to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/stephencelis/ghi&quot;&gt;ghi&lt;/a&gt;. Easy configuration and simple commands mean no more switching windows whenever I want to update issues. The only downside that I would mention is that the online documentation provided by ghi’s website and repo is not very clear especially when researching how to run a specific command. However, the help command provides great insight into the many commands available. I look forward to becoming more familiar with this tool and would recommend it to anyone who prefers working with the command line.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Week 1</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the first installment of my blog for CS378: Generic Programming and the STL. This class is the third class that I have taken with professor Downing but the first class in which I have attempted to keep up with a blog. I guess the third time is the charm!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every day of class begins with  a quiz over assigned readings and the previous lecture. This semester, Downing has moved from paper and pencil quizzes to conducting the quizzes online using Tophat.     Quizzes on Tophat feel no different than the previous paper and pencil quizzes. There are however more multiple     choice questions which are always a pleasure to see. After the quiz, Downing gives his lecture by calling on individual students to read/explain lines of code from the projector. This is by far the most interactive class I have taken. There’s nothing like the “fear” of your name being called next to keep you awake in class. I put fear in     quotations because even if you don’t know the answer to a question that Downing asks, he will work with you to arrive at an answer as best as he can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first full week of class centered on introducing our first project, Collatz, based on the Collatz conjecture. Having already completed this project in my Object Oriented Programming and Software engineering classes, completing this project was trivial. What makes this time different is the introduction of continuous integration with Travis CI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tip of the week: When working on a project, worry less about which editor and or additional tools you are going to use and worry more about actually completing the project. You can always come back afterwards if time permits. Example: I wanted to write my code for this first project in an IDE instead of vim because I thought it would be easier and improve my productivity. After many frustrations trying to set up the IDE for my project, I was still at square one. I switched to what I knew and was able to finish the project quickly. I am not saying to avoid learning to use new IDE’s and tools but to consider your priorites when working on a project. If you spend all your time setting up the development environment and end up with no end result then some adjustments need to be made..&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Welcome to Jekyll!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;You’ll find this post in your &lt;code&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add new posts, simply add a file in the &lt;code&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory that follows the convention &lt;code&gt;YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext&lt;/code&gt; and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;Tom&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints &amp;#39;Hi, Tom&amp;#39; to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll docs&lt;/a&gt; for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll&quot;&gt;Jekyll’s GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt;. If you have questions, you can ask them on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-help&quot;&gt;Jekyll’s dedicated Help repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
